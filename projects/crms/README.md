A customer is a non-customer at the first. 

A non-customer got his needs. These needs are weighted but not carefully calculated. For business customers, the needs are
measured in money: how much more to earn or how much less to spend.

At some point, a non-customer are exposed to our product. It may from the advertisement, the sold product of other customers, 
or the introduction of our marketing force. However, our product may not met his need well yet. That's why we have the sales force.

Our sales force will try his best to the needs with our product. The needs may be from a customer, or from a non-customer. 

Start from a non-customer. The needs remain mystery to the company. The sales force may 

	1. ask directly, by phone call, email, or a meeting
	
	2. deduct from statistics, business sense and logic
	
	3. apply strategies that worked before to similar customers
	
Neither way is guarenteed to success. The result is nothing but a guess of needs. The guess will be tested by an offer. The
guess will be improved after each loop. Looping is expensive because it consumes the patient of our non-customers/customers.

However, if customer needs are discovered finally, and if we can meet such needs, then we have the right to make a share from 
this business. First a customer value will be calculated. The calculation may be direct or non-direct, wehre non-direct means by comparing 
with alternative solutions. The calculated value must be acceptable to the customer. Our share is a portion of the customer value. 

Once the deal is made, we will deliver our product. The needs will be passed to the product department. 

Once the product is delivered, the payment will be collected by the finance guy. 

Also, the cost center takes care of the deployed products. They shall know the needs.

However, the sales agent shall always stand with the customer. He shall be our guy with our customer, and our customer's guy with us. 

We satisfy our customer because a satisfied customer brings more customer and more deals to us. Also, some of the customers who we satisfied
the best is considered core customers who shall be served with privilledge.

There will be competitors who want to serve our customer better. Sometimes we lose a customer to them. However, if we keep track with 
the needs of our customers closely and satisfy them well, then the customers will have no reason to migrate.
