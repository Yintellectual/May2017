Our business is to provide some product that fulfills some requirments of the people. 

We target at such a set of requirements because it is profitable. Our price comes from the customer value added by fulfilling the
requirement. Actually, a requirement is an oppotunity to add value to the customers' business. Some of the requirements add small value
to a cutomer, but it is common across the people. Some are rare, but add great value to one single customer. Our price minus our cost
is our profit. We do business for profit. 

People may not know their requirements, or know it wrongly. However, we are expert in our targeting requirements, therefore we will
decide if a person has such a set of requirements. Specifically, our salesman decides it. 

If a person has our targeting requirements, then he is a potential customer.

If not, then he is irrelevent to our business. 

A customer is person who accepted our product. It is our job to make the customer pay in money or other ways. 

Turning a potential customer into a customer is important for enterprise business. The key is to fulfill their requirements fast with less 
incidental costs. To achieve this, the requirements must be revealed truely by interview to the potential customer or its competitors. 

Knowing the requirements of the customer is the key of our business. The requirements shall be updated frequently to reflect the change in 
the real market. 

One customer may have many requirements in different priorities. The priorities matter. 

Our salesman detect the requirements with priorities and calculate their customer values. Our headcore know the size of the potential customer 
pool therefore know the expecting price of a product. 

Our headcore also know our price based on the customer value and our competitors. 

The customer relationship is measured by the customer value. 


Our CRMs is a tool to keep track on the requirements collected by our salesman from our customers and potential customers. 

A customer has some requiremets each has a customer value. However, a requirement may also has strategic meanings to the customer, thus the priorities
may vary from customer to customer, from time to time. 

A salesman is one of our crew who represent our company to our customer and represent our customer in our company. Such a man knows both the requirements 
and the products. They work for us because we provide the supporting platform including the suitable products for his cutomer. 

A requirement has a name.

Our CRMs keeps tracking with the activities of our salesman. A activity is an interaction between the salseman and the customer.
An activity may be asking about the requirement, making an offer, and collecting the feedback. 



Our CRMs serves both the salesmen and the manager of the salesman. The salesmen use our CRMs to record his activities. Our manager use
our CRMs to see the records of his salesman. The records can be valuable to the salesmen too because it may reveal statistics over customers. 





------------------------------------------------
A customer is a non-customer at the first. 

A non-customer got his needs. These needs are weighted but not carefully calculated. For business customers, the needs are
measured in money: how much more to earn or how much less to spend.

At some point, a non-customer are exposed to our product. It may from the advertisement, the sold product of other customers, 
or the introduction of our marketing force. However, our product may not met his need well yet. That's why we have the sales force.

Our sales force will try his best to the needs with our product. The needs may be from a customer, or from a non-customer. 

Start from a non-customer. The needs remain mystery to the company. The sales force may 

	1. ask directly, by phone call, email, or a meeting
	
	2. deduct from statistics, business sense and logic
	
	3. apply strategies that worked before to similar customers
	
Neither way is guarenteed to success. The result is nothing but a guess of needs. The guess will be tested by an offer. The
guess will be improved after each loop. Looping is expensive because it consumes the patient of our non-customers/customers.

However, if customer needs are discovered finally, and if we can meet such needs, then we have the right to make a share from 
this business. First a customer value will be calculated. The calculation may be direct or non-direct, wehre non-direct means by comparing 
with alternative solutions. The calculated value must be acceptable to the customer. Our share is a portion of the customer value. 

Once the deal is made, we will deliver our product. The needs will be passed to the product department. 

Once the product is delivered, the payment will be collected by the finance guy. 

Also, the cost center takes care of the deployed products. They shall know the needs.

However, the sales agent shall always stand with the customer. He shall be our guy with our customer, and our customer's guy with us. 

We satisfy our customer because a satisfied customer brings more customer and more deals to us. Also, some of the customers who we satisfied
the best is considered core customers who shall be served with privilledge.

There will be competitors who want to serve our customer better. Sometimes we lose a customer to them. However, if we keep track with 
the needs of our customers closely and satisfy them well, then the customers will have no reason to migrate.
