Yesterday we got a skeleton design for my cloud based application. There are two vital tools that should 
be studied in depth: RabbitMQ and Java Data. 

Also, the skeloton design which contains only the user-case diagram, should be further developed. State 
diagrams or class diagrams could be the next step. 

I got about 12 hours today.
