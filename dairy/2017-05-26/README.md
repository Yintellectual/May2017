Eric Evans' book "Domain Driven Design",

RabbitMQ

Lomber

http://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories from 5.6.2

Today, a very enlightening boot is spotted:

	Domian Driven Design. 
	
This book is published in 2003, sponsored by Martin Fowler who is the most respectable enterprise software expert to me. 

This book is 440 pages long, consists of 4 parts and 17 chapters. The reading can be hard, but I'm going to read it through.

By my standard reading speed, reading this book can take 44 hours. If I spend 4 hours per day, then the book can be finished before
June, 7. However, I wish to achieve it faster with less cost. If I pay attention to reading techniques, then maybe my reading speed
can get improved along the way, thus less time can be consumed. Also, maybe I can read more back home, which means the computer will
be carried home.

Today I'm going to explore lomber tools, learning more about RabbitMQ and UML, reading Domain-Driven Development, read some more about 
java data, and make progress in my CRM system.
