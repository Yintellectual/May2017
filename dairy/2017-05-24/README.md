		uml from IBM, saved on the phone


		
Yesterday RabbitMQ and Spring Data has been sampled. Both require great details before deployment. 

Also, 7 diagrams from UML is now familiar tools. Sequence diagram is used in real project, and an 
online diagram tool has been rent for future usage. 

Now a new direction is what I need. 

I've promised three things to be done within this month: 

		notes management,
		part time job
		POC project for enterprise application
		
So far, notes management is achieved beautifully through git tools. The next part time job is two weeks later 
in the next month, therefore nothing to worry about. However, the POC project is still an open field.

Beyound the promise, there are also many other possible directions: TOEFL English, freelance job hunting, OCJP8
Exam, and College Education. Practicing English and taking exams for freelance.com seems interesting to me.

Generally speaking, in the next two weeks, an Enperprise Application should be developed. If there is free time, then 
English and exams for freelance.com will be taken care of. 


The procedure of Enterprise Application development is :

	1. High Level Design
	
	2. Microservice Design&Development

		2.1 Layer DD
		
	3. Aspect Design&Development
	
	4. UI Design&Development
	
	5. Update and Maintainese

	
	The design is made by writing and results in uml diagram
	
	The development is Test-Driven towards interfaces, and results in OO classes.


	
There will be many tools that are necessary for this project:

	MySQL or some database
	
	Spring Data JPA
	
	Spring Data Rest
	
	RestTemplate (Spring Web)
	
	Eureka
	
	RabbitMQ
	
	Thymleaf
	
	Bootstrap

	
The design would copied from some existing project. 
	
To make life simple, the components are developed by priority.

Entities

Json & Rest API
	
Authentication

UI

Now, lets get started!
