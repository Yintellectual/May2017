From 2 to 11, I will arrange 8 hours work time plus 1 hour dinner time.

Today the work is all about charts. I wish to produce 6 charts today and 10 more charts tomorrow. 

I will have refreshment with coffee after 5, and then dinner with coffee after 9. 

The first thing is to study chartJS and leave some notes, which takes about one hour.

The second thing is to list all the charts that I can ever think about, a brainstorm. This activity requires high self-esteem and high level of energy. 

The third thing is to review the list of charts and select 6 charts to implement.

The forth to ninth things are implementing the charts.
