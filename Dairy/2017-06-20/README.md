Well, from now on there are still seven hours available today. 

The most interesting matter to me is to display the chat messages nicely using spring-cloud-websocket technology. 
However, this matter involves expert level front-end skills, which I don't have. I can either find a template online, or spend about 40 hours reading the JS book. 

The websocket client should automatically destory old messages in order not to explode my clients' computer. 

Different types of message better displayed in different area\window.

Even in the same window, message are weighted and emphasized into different level. 

Also, more functions should be added.

1. usernames should be followed by the reown

2. user history should be available by clicking on the usernames

3. statistics of today comparing to the old days should be available

4. today's important information should be displayed on some fixed area
