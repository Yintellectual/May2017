My project comes to a point that the repository has been finished. To deliver the product before the end of this month, I want it to be useful and then beautiful. 

At the mean time, my health need special attention. I may invest sometime for exercises, and pay more attention on the right use of my body during work.

God I love my new office as well as the key board. 

Return to my project. Since the gift handler has been finished, what I need next is a way to analysis the data, and a way to report my discovery to the end user. 

Considering the first delivery dues this week, I have only few hours to explorer for the wisdom of data mining. However, I still believe that displaying useful information comes before displaying things beautifully. 

Then the question become, can useful things can I learn from the gift data?

Before asking this question, first ask that what can I ever learn from the gift data. 

We have studied the customer satisfaction theory which says that the customers who brought us the most profit are the heart of our business. The data will show us about the money we collected from each customer. There by, we know exactly how many customers we have. Since the number may go very big and most of them may contribute not much to our business, we may group them up into several classes. What is the percentage of contribution from the 80% customers? What is the percentage of contribution hold by the champion? What is the percentage of contribution of the middle class? 

Also, since our data is well labelled by timestamps, we can also find out the change of each customers contribution over time. I may guess that the model may like waves, customers come and go like waves. There must be some loyal poor guys, loyal middle class, and some one time middle class. We will know who are they. 

We need a front-end chart framework to help to show the discovery.

Today I would have a bar chart to display all the rocket customers with height of the chart as rocket counter for that customer. The chart should dynamic and driven by the real time data. 

I will spend hours to read about chartJS, and to use its functionality of adding new data and updating data.

After then, I will have websocket to deliver the data to chartJS.

Basically, there should be method that controls the behavior of the chart, which is then called by sockJS
