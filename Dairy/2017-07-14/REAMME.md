I got more than 12 hours. 

We've already come to the point where a chart is backed by a chart service that consists of a data minor that processes the data and a chart data cacher that contains the chart data. For the real time data, event listener pattern can be useful. Also, since the whole process of serving a chart has many steps that may vary from different instances, decorator pattern maybe valuable in this case. 

Today, I will spend about 2 hours review and sample both patterns first, then come up with a design to reform the existing generic 2D chart service. After doing so, I will adjust the layout of the homepage and add multiple charts onto it.
