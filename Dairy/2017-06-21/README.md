Today I got a lot time to invest into my programming career. 


There will be 8 hours work time plus 1 hour lunch time. After work, 
there will be 3 hours or more free time plus 1 hour dinner time.
Before work, there is about 20min free time. 

Today I'm going to achieve a lot things. First, I'm gonna sell my spring validation update
to my boss. Second, the editing over email template will be sold to my boss too. After then,
maybe one or two hours later, I will implement the next bug fix. This bug fix will be sold before
the end today. If I got lucky enough, I can fix the fourth bug. 

Beyond my job, I'm going to read more about cloud foundry. I would love to ask a friend to deliver a book
about cloud foundry from the US. I also would love to learn some advanced knowledge about javascript. In 
addition, my project need a lot coding and some debugging over the lombok @ToString();
