Today I got do a lot work. Besides of the work, I have to talk to my customer, Mr. Li. 

The plan is to first make a project and sample the calendar. Second, make another project and sample the pdf api. 
Third, make a third project and sample a sit system. 

We have to work under TDD principle. 

start from 2pm

Today, I gonna have a early and good sleep. Before that, I'm going to read through the description on iptables provided by red hat community. 

Today, what I have learned is iptables FORWARD which I found very hard to grasp a few of days ago. I'm satisfied about this understanding, not only because of the great power of FORWARD itself, but also about the possiblity for me to understand the whole rest of the story about iptables. 

Infact, till the last week I never sure about the questions like is ubunut a Linux or is a firewall a router. This kind of facts are so basic that no one ever explicitly make it clear enough to easy my struggling. No matter what, I have to struggle like this unless I can find a trustworthy teacher who could never be found. 

Now the time is 2:20 pm, I just had lunch and a rest. I can read for three hours before dinner and maybe one or two hours after dinner and before 8pm. 

The material that I have to read about iptables are from 7.1.1 to 7.6, about 8000 words in total which can be finished within 80 min. The first half of the articles are familiar to me. However, the second half, start from FORWARD, can be very difficult. Experiments are necessary costs to gain an insight of this very powerful tool. 

In summary, I may spend 80 min on reading, 80 min on taking notes and 80 min on experimentations, which makes up to 4 hours. The first one and half hours should be spent on reviewing the familiar topics. After that, two and half an hour will be spent on the hard topics. 

Lets get started.
