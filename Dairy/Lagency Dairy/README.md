==========2017-04-22=========>

I have to do laundry and house cleaning in this Saturday. After then, I will move to a cafe to organize a profile for English translation works. 

The blue grammar book should be used before the end of the day.
==========2017-04-21=========>

Yesterday I've finished the study on OCPJ8 objectives.

Today, I'm going to create a static mock website for my sales management system. 

This mock website should be built in short loops. Each loop has a goal and a time slot of about 10 - 20 minutes. Before the looping starts, the environment should be set first. 

The plan is that before 1pm this would be one hour for me to do research on static website development. 

After lunch, from 2 to 5, I will do about 15 to 20 looping which result in a mock website view that is desired. 

In the evening, I will practice toefl exam reading and writing first for about 1 hour, followed by imitating and speaking practice for about 1 hour. Going back home, I will use the blue grammar book and have a good sleep. 

------------------------------
The FOUR DAYS GOAL: 20, 21, 22, 23(SUNDAY)

In these 4 days, 

first the study on OCJP8 should be accomplished. 

Second, the toefl exam should be further prepared and another practice exam should be taken in sunday. d

Third, a basic design of my own CRM system should be made. 

Last, I should have a sound profile for english translator job before the next monday. 

==========2017-04-20=========>

Since I was taking one day off yesterday, I should continue from April 18. 

I've learned a lot in April 18.

The first thing is about rabbitTemplate which is the very powerful messaging tool for spring applications. 

The second thing is about spring test. I'm going to further practice it with the rest of the java.time exercises.

The third thing is a new life style based on the study room provided by the shjt university, which allows cheaper but more productive working. 

The forth thing is the first exploration over the translation market. 

Today, from half past nine to about nine pm, I got about 12 hours to spend. I'm going to have lunch and dinner in the restaurant with 2 hours. For the rest 10 hours, I'm going to do mostly about 3 kinds of things: studying java.time, designing my CRM, and practicing for toefl exam. 




==========2017-04-19=========>

 n6. visiting hunan road 328, at 5pm

Design Enterprise Application in PaaS based on the reference website

exploring freelance.com, 

apply for a job as translator or programmer.


==========2017-04-18=========>

Here comes the question: what is the most urgent thing for me to do at this moment?

To answer this question, first list all the things that I should do in a short time:

	make money

	develop a POC project for cloud foundry based enterprise application

	have a company registered

	have investment from inversters

	have a homepage designed and deployed for me and my company

	have a certification on English

	have a certification on Java programming

	have a certification of university graduation

	
Basically, I need to make some money within 2 months. I also need a POC that demonstrates the power of Paas. 

Well, actually, a POC that demonstrates the power of paas is the most important thing because it will open my career as an enterprise application architect, help me convince investers, and prove my capablity to my family. 

Therefore, I'm going to do research on the most typical use of cloud computing in business management. Then I will start a project to accomplish my own application that satisfies the requrements of this use. Once I have this project done, I can discuss it with my family and my investers. 

My money is sufficient for about 3 weeks living here in Shanghai. As long as I make decisive progress in my project, I won't have to worry about my inteperator career anymore. 

If I can't progress as planed, then I need to look for oppotunities in business translation.

However, it won't hurt to put an eye on the translating marcket from today. I can write an listener service to check the 58.com for me within one or two days. I can also start working on a more proper account in freelance.com. 

Therefore, 1. listener for 58.com, 3. research on the use of cloud computing in enterprise application, 4. reviewing java.time, 5. visiting regus.com, 6. visiting hunan road 328, 7. toefl practice, and 8. the blue grammar book 2. exploring freelance.com, should be done today. 

Wow, thats a lot to do. 

-----5:30pm plan for the evening---

First, I will do experiements and practices to close the chapter on java.time. This process can take one hour. 

After then, I will go to the restaurant for dinner. This process take about one hour. 

After that, I will find a place, maybe in starbucks to practise on TOEFL english. It takes about two hours, including reading, imitation and speaking, and 400 words essay writing. 

last I will go back and use the blue grammar book, it takes only like 10 seconds. 

-----------------------------------

Enterprise Application in PaaS

I'm going to do CRM. One reason is that CRM is the most commonly used enterprise software. Since it works directly with the sales department, the value it adds to the customers can be easy to see. The second reason is that I've already learned the basics about CRM and customer satisfaction. 

Two valuable reference resources has been secured:

 http://www.zitoo.com.cn/Selection/OneProductDetail.aspx?id=43 
 http://crm.qikebao.com/signin with username admin and password 12345

The design will start tomorrow. 



Today i'm going to do 4 kinds of things.

1. Doing research on the advantages of messaging over restful supplier&consumers.

2. Doing experiments over the classes defined in java.time package, and finish the summary and quiz.

3. In the afternoon, visit regus in the afternoon. I need hard evidence to convince my parents. Many key features to look into is already included in the email to maggie.

4. returning from regus, I will spend my time in Shanghai Jiaotong University to further practice TOEFL english. All of the 4 aspects, reading, writing, listening and speaking will be practiced in two or three hours. This process is considered easy, because I'm already familliar with this kind of practice. 

Research can not be long. The reason is that doing research usually lacks of a thorough plan, an accurate direction, or a certain book to read and learn. Everytime something new is added to my knowledge, I need time to organize my mind and plan for the next move. Otherwise, either time is wasted on reading useless stuffs, or I got fructrated for not achieving an non-existing goal after long and hard working.

I think a research loop can be less than 30 min to 2 hours at maximum. I can do multiple looping everyday is things are well organized, which can be more fruitful than ever.




==========2017-04-17=========>
Today is raining. I took me 4 hours to setting down in the starbucks. 

Today I'm going to get contact to regus to secure an office for me. It is really unacceptable to waste time on pointless travelling and low efficiency working due to the noise. The money for an office can be earned from translating works. 

Therefore I have to get a translation work. The TOEFL exam can only help if I got an amazing score which is very hard to achieve. So far, my skills have been improved but more work need to be done in the following area:

	Vocabulary is slightly not enough for the exam. Maybe I should use the vocabulary builder. However, reading such a book is time consuming and may no help much due to the exam is around the corner.

	Speaking has been greatly impoved by the recent training. I should keep doing the imitation exercise everyday to further improve it. 

	Listening by itself is fine, but note taking is still hard for me. More note taking techniques should be researched for. 

	Writing should not be a problem. However, due to the lack of vocabulary and note taking techniques, I'm facing problems to finish the essay in time. 

Today I'm planing to extend the work load comparing to the past few days. 8 hours work should be secured. However, my energy is limited and so far 6 hours work can exhaust me. I will try to have lunch in starbucks in order to keep my favorate sit. Also, the second choice other than the starbucks should be considered. 

About the places to work, there are about 4 good places for me. 

The first one is the study lounge which is mean for self-study with good AC and quite environment. The disadvantage of it is the horrible network. Also, the self-study room is all about lamb kids. In addition, I don't feel comfortable typing there because of the noise I made. Basically, 

So far, none of the above are problems. I'm now using the 4G network from my phone and a tiny program gives me a sound feedback through earphone that allows me to type quietly. Therefore, the studying room can be the first choice for any kind of work except those related to speaking. 

The second place is the cafeteria in the law school. It's pros and cons are almost the same with the studying room, but the people there is cooler at the cost of money and unwanted noise. Besides, this cafe got the best sofa which makes it a prefect place to rest maybe to read. 

The third choice for work is the tables and chairs behind the student service office. This place is outdoor and got no wife at all. I would only sit there if the weather is just right and if I want to make some noise. 

The last choice, which is not least, is the current chair that i'm using. This is a outdoor table of the starbucks around the cornor. It is quite, windy, and has access to starbucks coffee and wifi. I like the people in the starbucks and I need their coffee. In this corner, I'm also free to do some training on the oral English. 

In summary, I need to come up with a place for me to practice oral English at the end of the day. For the rest of the time, I should work in the studying lounge. 


Today I got about 10 hours to spend. However, considerring 2 out of the 6 full energy hour has been spent on fundamental works, today gonna be tough. 

The work that should be done today are about TOEFL, OCJP8, Spring-boot framework, AWS integration in spring boot, and CloudFoundry setting up in AWS server. 

TOEFL and OCJP8 related works are considered easy, while researches on spring, cloudfoundry and aws are considered hard. 

Besides of all the academic works, I also need to look for an office for future use. Even though the combination of the study lounge and starbucks can meet almost all my need in monthes or years if I purchase a powerful laptop, an office is still desired for the comfort, freedom and self-recognization it provides.

==========2017-04-14=========>
Time is short. The weather is good today, but it can be windy and the temperature drops fast in the afternoon. If it gets code, then I either has to find some other caffee that is warm, or stop working and go home. A cafeteria can be noisy and full of unwanted eye contacts. 

Today is Friday and 2 weeks before the TOEFL exam. I still wonder if can get a convincing score in the exam. I should reach like 110 to use it as a proof to my capability. This goal is a little bit too high, but I can't get any advice over it. 

In sunday, there maybe a tutorial on english essay writing as well as speaking and listening. I should work towards it to make best use of this chance. Which means, take the second practice exam. 

I can take the practice exam today or tomorrow, depends on the the plan. 

Basically, everyday in the morning I will spend about 2 hours on oral English. After it, I will have a lunch with one hour. In the afternoon, although I got time and energy, it is just difficult to find a peaceful and warm place to study. Maybe the studying room in the next building is a good place, but there must be some reason have stopped from going there. I may also spend time on the cafe in my neighbourhood, but that cafe is cood too. I wish to have an office. 

Anyway, at least 4 hour in the afternoon can be secured which is good enough already. However, here comes another question, which is can I take 4 hours exam after 2 hours english training? Even if I do, it could be a challenge. What if I fail? What is I got poor score? What if I was interrupted because of the trouble with the network?

I need to know how much do I still have, then build a financial plan to make sure that I can make it to the last monday this month. 

Maybe I don't have to set the standard so high. I can just keep going and take the TOEFL exam. Even if the score is not every high, I can still find some job oppotunity and earn some money. 

To make sure the practice test goes smoothly, I will install expressvpn on my laptop. If it doesn't work, then i will purchase the Xunda VPN which definitely works. 

I will embrace myself and talk to my mom about the practice test. Also, I will clean my mind carefully before the test starts. It will help me to finish the test. 

The score from the practice test, good or bad, is just a tool to help me plan the next move. I know what I've achieved in the last month. I also sure about that my current english skill is good enough for my programming career, as well as my inteperator career. 

Now the only question so far is to do take the test today, or tomorrow. I think tomorrow is better because I need to prepare on the essay writing as well as speaking. That's how I plan for today:

10-12 : oral English

12-01 : Lunch

01-02 : Reading Strategies on rhetorical functions, and Essay writing strategies.

02-03 : Practice essay writing, unlimited time, with planing and editing, followed by analysing on the sample answer as well as self reviewing.

03-04 : Research on online CF developing environment

04-05 : Next chapter of OCJP8

----------------

Washing cloth + having rest, but keep in mind that watching the wabcam show or reading the news can harm my sleep.

 







==========2017-04-13=========>

Today I'm going to allocate only 6 hours work before 6 o'clock, which means I got 2 hours to rest in the daytime. I'm going to spend this time to have a lunch somewhere around cafeteria. 

First I will have a 2 hours training on oral english. Second, I'm going to summarize java Stream and then take the quiz. 

After three hours work, I'm going to take a bike to the cafeteria and have lunch. Although I got a lot things to worry about, like English essey writing and cloud architect, I will set myself free to enjoy my lunch. No matter how hard things can be, or how the people think about a young man with no schoolarship and no job, I've achieved a lot this year. At least I've got a certificaion on java 7 right now and I'm about to get my TOEFL score. I can communicate in English with no problem and I can read almost any English material. I know the spring-boot and is capable of developing and deploying small SaaS for casual use or temporary business purpose. More importantly, I know how to motivate myself as well as people around me. I'm the one who hold a value and holds it tight. In one word, I know I've achieved a lot this year and I deserve a good lunch. Well, just don't spend too much money on it. 

In the afternoon, I got 3 hours to spend. The problem is, doing a research without a book is super hard. Maybe I should focus on the OCJP8 and TOEFL books instead of keep digging online. The reason is only the risk of not learning anything valuable in the research, but also about the frustration of knowing it. On the other hand, if I spend more time on designing the roadmap of the research, can do it with better techniques, then maybe valuable breakthough may happen from the research. Considerring the OCJP8 certification is rather irrelavent and the English skill is not going to improve a lot in one day, I prefer to do some research on the cloud architecture this afternoon, with more time and energy. I fully aware the risk and if I failed, I won't blame myself and will just try it again tomorrow with improved methodology. 

I love the young man who is typing this text, deeply. 




==========2017-04-12=========>

My company:

	Should I register a company? To answer this question, I need to know the value of a company to me, as well as the cost of running a company. 
Running a company cost money in two ways, fees and texes. The fee can be like 300 per month, and 3600 per year which is not a big deal. The text can be as high as 20% of my total profit. However, if all the cost count to the company, then my profit can be very low or even negative. That is, the total cost of money of runing the company can be as low as 300 per month. However, the time and energy spent on the registerting and managing the company can be way more expensive than the direct cost. For example, I still have no idea how to get the address and partners for my company. Worrying about such matters can consume days.

	On the other hand, the benefit of owning a company is not clear, too. Sometimes I wonder that having a company helps me to win a contract, but this may not be true because once people look into my company and team they will just understand the situation. Having a company may also open access to some services for me. For example, the sms service which is necessary for morden SaaS or PaaS. In addition, being a company owner, I may get the visa to the US, or borrow loan more easily. 

	To be honest, non of the benefit from owning a company is proven necessary. Thus, the registering should be delayed no matter how low the cost is. 


==========2017-04-12=========>
Today I had a good sleep. From 5am to 9pm, I got a lot of time to invest. 

Today the most important thing is to learn as more as possible about TOEFL speaking and listening, because tomorrow 7 to 8:30 I got a english meeting. This event is sponsored by a English education organization at a relatively cheap price. It would be the one of the best chance for me to 
practice oral english. Also, I hope to make few friends that can help me with TOEFL. I would love to have a peer student who is sincere and diligent, or a tutor who is well educated and not very expensive. I should make a sprint on Oral English today, not only to be prepared in the meeting, but also earn more chance to make friends there. 

Today, as everyday, I got many different works to do. Except of preparing for TOEFL, there are OCJP8, blue grammar book, Spider project, and business things like registering my company, rent a server from AWS, registering the domain for my company, and getting visa to US. Today I'm going to finish OCJP8 Streams, blue grammar book the second quiz on who/whom/that/which. The Spider project is actually a big challenge to me, so does the business things. The bottom line is: one challenge per day. 

So far, I'm very curious about how to get a group of servers work together by using the Spring-cloud technology. I got to review its documentation before step further on the Spider project. 

Time Table:

5 : making a plan about TOEFL speaking and listening.

6 : TOEFL speaking and listening session 1

7 : TOEFL speaking and listening session 2

8:-- breakfast, noodles and pork

9: get to work

10 : Continue OJCP8 Stream

16:30------------------------

	I got about 4 hours left today. Since there will be a English party tomorrow, I'm going to spend sometime on the TOEFL listening. After it, I can read through the spring-cloud reference. 

	So far, I worry about one question very much: how to organize and manage the microservices? I want my spider can run on multiple AWS servers and can dynamically start and drop servers in order to save money while performance. This is a big question to ask, maybe I should break it up into small step. I think the first step is to have two microservices registered to the cloud infrastructure. Well, actually this small step can break into even smaller steps, for example, to create a cloud infrastructure first. Actually, I can set up the cloud infrastructure step by step. Once I got a cloud infrastructure in one server, I can learn to automatically start service on the second server. Finally, I will study the aws api and learn to rent a server automatically.

	Time is 5 pm, I can read 30 pages this today at most. At this speed, the reference will be finished in about 4 days. Therefore, there is no need to rush. So the best thing I can do is to practice more on TOEFL listening and then spend one or two hours to look into the spring-cloud reference.

Today I got contact with a girl. This girl is sweet and lives in the same apartment with me. However, I know that only the most attactive and educated girls can hold me for long. I don't want to break her heart or mine. However, it would be great to have someone on my side. I will try 
to have a talk with her and see if I can offer help. I wish my finance can be less tight, but so far, I have to develop this friendship with as 
low cost as possible. 

Today, I took a rest and did house cleaning & cloth washing. Such a effort on life will allow me to focus on my work in the next 4 days. 

I also developed a plan to continue the study of spring-boot and to get a feeling about PaaS and cloud foundry. 

I really hate those peasants all around the city and my life. Right now one of them is sitting beside me, suffering from my presence. Still, I'm glade that it is him who suffer not me. I hope someday I can be powerful enough to get rid of those uncultured pathetics or to make them behave in front of me. I don't really hate them, just hate of them to create distraction toward me. 

I'm going back home before 6. Back home, I will continue the architectural planing of the spider service. 

This afternoon in zoo coffee, I should finish reading of the 30 strategies about the first writing question. The key is to practice taking notes. I will practice this skill further during the study of listening. Also, I should keep in mind that no personal opinions should be included in this writing. Last but not least, remember that use present tense to refer to the passage. 

I wish I can have time to read more about OCJP8 today, as well as the blue grammar book.

==========2017-04-02=========>
Today I will carry on with the plan of April. 

However, instead of starting at 7, today I start at half past 10. 

Have to say that the low class human being troubles me a lot. I really hate these people because I can't earn anything valuable from them and I 
can't use them to achieve my own goals. I feel vulnerable with the influence from them. I need to build prestige in order to distinguish myself
from these people and keep them inline when they are working close to me. Such an prestige will also help me to migrate to better places where people are more like me. Knowledge itself will not earn prestige for me, however, I believe if I invest my power of knowledge into business, then I will be rewarded with good money. The money earn from business is not only the fundation of my prestige, but also a step for me to get into the leading areas of the human society, like politics, economics and millitary. If I work fully in April, then I will be no doubt start my business in May. For the sake of keeping the peasants away from me,  I need to perform!

Starting from 11 in the morning, todays working time will be interrupted by shopping and dinner at 5pm for about 2 hours. After dinner, I wish I can invest more time into further studies. Actually, at least one hour's work on the blue grammar book should be done. 

Today's work is about a long session on TOEFL writing, summarizing the 4 different messaging technologies introduced by yesterday's chapter from the book Pro Spring-boot, and to read carefully through the next chapter on OJCP8. The blue grammar book will be studied in the cafe after dinner. If I still got free time after everything is settled, then I will celebrate myself by taking a house cleaning. 

It appears that the TOEFL iBT allows taking notes using pen and paper. Therefore, pen and paper will be loaded in my bag to facilitate practicing TOEFL sample questions. 

The TOEFL guiding book contains mainly practice questions and strategies for reading, listening, speaking and writing. I read and write academic english a lot everyday, thus strategies alone on reading and writing are helpful to me. However, I don't have many chance to listen to lectures or to give a speech in English in my daily life, thus the practice questions on listening and speeking are valuable assets. Actually, the audio resources are the decisive reason for me to purchased the book. Considerring listening and speaking questions are relatively easier than the reading and writing ones in TOEFL iBT, and writing practice greatly uplifts the overall English skill thus benefits the other 3 aspects of TOEFL, it is reasonable for me to study the general strategies on reading and writing that helps my daily use of English first with patient and good effort. However, small effort is also necessary to keep my speaking and listening skills sharp before they become the focus. 

However, the TOEFL guiding book keep the strategies in an less orgnized way which makes the wisdom inside hard to remember and less straitforward. To use the book, the wisdom must be extracted and reorginized in an logically structured and abstract way. The whole plan of studying the TOEFL guidance is about spotting, orgnizing and remembering the wisdom of the English language. In order to achieve high score in the exam, the pace of learning can be slow to ensure correct understanding and integrous absorbing. 

However, English is more than a TOEFL guidance. Vacabulary, word-forming rules, advanced reading techniques, essay writing, art of speech and noting techniques are all hard books to read. While learning the TOEFL guidance, I should also keep looking for the most benefitial topic that can help further improve my score with best return/effort ratio.



The plan goes here:

11  : making a plan for the study on TOEFL writing

12  : The first writing session

1   : The seond writing session, or a reading session

2   : Lunch, reviewing Pro Spring-boot

3   : Reading session 1 on the next chapter on OCJP8, fast read, about 20 pages

4   : Reading session 2 on the next chapter on OJCP8, fast read, about 20 pages work load

Shopping and having dinner at home.

7   : The Blue Grammar Book

8   : Reading session 3 or house cleaning

9   : Reading session 4 or house cleaning


==========2017-04-01=========>
I woke up between 5pm to 6 pm yesterday. Before the morning, I've spent about 2 hours to finish the diagnose test of TOEFL. I still have 
some time during the day. I can stay awake comfortablely for about 18 hours after a full sleep, which means I will not get sleepy before the 
mid of the day. However, I can't sleep before the early night of today if I want to put my living time back to normal. Therefore, I got 9 hours
struggle time to deal with. I would love to stay alert and learn something in the afternoon and to relax in the last two or three hours before 
9 o'clock. The key of keeping me in track is no supprise: coffee. 

The plan goes here:

	six hours in the morning{

		2 hours: taking a nap and wake up before 7, taking shower, dressing up and having breakfast.

		1 hour: having a coffee and reviewing the last chapter of OCJP8, about generics and collections with Streams, and taking the quiz. 

		3 hours: reading the next chapter of spring-boot		

	}and six hours in the afternoon{
		
		TOFEL.

		Today I'm doing the reading part of TOFEL. This part is 100 pages' long, which can definitely be finished 10 hours. I'm not going to 
		skip any thing from it. 

		I've already spotted several weaknesses from the diagnose test. For reading, I need to extend my vacabulary to understand the 				options offered by the vacabulary questions. Also, I need to read and answer the question faster to ensure all the question can be 
		finished in time. 

		For listening, maybe I should develop my skills of taking notes not only to catch more details in an organized way, but also to 
		spot logically meaningfull information from the audio. 

		For speaking, I need to orgnize my language faster and train myself to provide solid evidence or examples to support any of 
		my argument. I also need to improve the way I talk to be more confident, clearer and attractive.

		I don't have any idea to improve my writing so far. 

		Now, back to today's plan. Today I'm going to take half of the reading chapter, which means to read the general strategies for 
		reading and strategies for the first 5 types of questions. All the practices comming in my way will be dealt with. There will be 
		6 sessions in the afternoon and I will stop at page 65. 		 

	}and one hour homework time{
		
		the blue grammar book

		I'm sure that I would be very tired at the end of the day, but no matter how hard it is, I will answer a group of questions on 
		english grammar. 

	}


	I will celebrate such a day with a very good night.
 

==========Grand Plan for April, Expirimental=========>

Each day about 8 hours working time is allocated. Among which, 3 hours are used to finish reading a chapter in OCJP8 or Spring-boot. 
In the next day, one additional hour is spent to review such a chapter and finish the quizes is any. The rest of the time will be spent
on TOEFL. TOEFL can only be studied at home or in starbucks. One hour review has privilige over chapter reading. The whole structure of 
a working day could be like what is shown below:

	Early in the morning, after having breakfast in the nearest chinese restaurant and a 10 minutes rest at home, I will be practicing 
for the TOEFL exam in starbucks with a cup of coffee. After 4 hours work, I will walk to the zoo cafe and have brealunch with a big cup of 
coffee. After the refreshment, I will be reviewing a chapter that has been read the last day. Then, I will switch to the other book and 
read a new chapter. After about 2 hours reading, I will have desserts and rest for about 10 minutes. After then, I will finish the chapter. 
If the time is still early and I feel good for practicing more on TOEFL, then I will walk back into starbucks and pick up TOEFL again with a 
cup of coffee which may or may not be actually used. After then, I will be tired and have achieved a lot. I will walk back home and maybe do 
some house cleaning and/or laundry before going to the bed. The show of my favorate singer, American tv shows, news, or posts on international 
political from my favorate writers are fun things to consume but are not allowed to delay my sleep time.  



==========2017-03-30=========>

Today is a new beginning after two weeks' rest. In the comming month, two exams shall be considered seriously. The first
one is TOEFL and the second one is OCJP8. Textbooks for both exams has arrived. 

Besides the exams, the book on Spring-boot should be learned thoroughly, too. 

The TOEFL textbook offered enough practice questions in the book and online. The website should be explored fully, and 
an overall strategy for preparation on TOEFL should be carried out, today. So far as I concern, the preparation shall be 
practice-centered, because I'm already getting high score in practice ready&listening questions, and the textbook is mostly
about strategies of answering questions that can be only fully absorbed in practice. However, the detailed plan can only
be made once the structure of the textbook is clear to me.

In the first few days, I should invest most of the time into TOEFL preparation. Once the skills are mastered, an exam should
be arranged and the focus will switch to OCJP8. At the mean time, all of TOEFL, OCJP8, spring-boot, the blue gramma book shall 
not be interrupted. An minimum invest of about half to one hour's effort should be applied on any of the four areas. 

Below is the time table for today:

10, 11, 12, 

1:00 move to the zoo and have lunch with a huge cup of coffee

1, 2, 3, 

4:00 dessert

4, 5, 6, 

7:00 go home and have dinner

9 hours coffee time + homework time

9 hours coffee time{

	1 hour{
		0.5 hour{
			time scheduling
		}and 0.5hour{
			exploring the website of the toefl textbook

			*the access of the website is very slow from starbucks, which may not sufficient for getting audio tracks.
			*it takes 30sec for the webapp to response.
			*interestingly, the player runs rebustly. 

			conclusion:

			I can rely on the online course provided by kaptest.com with Kaplan TOEFL iBT book. However, a more reliable 
			VPN for my labtop is desirable. 

			The interesting thing is that kaptest.com is accessable through the native network. However, using the green
			VPN may speed up my visiting. 

			Xunda VPN speeds up kaptest.com significately. However, the VPN traffic may get overloaded when downloading 
			videos. Purchase multiple VPN accounts if necessary. 

			Sadly, my prefered cafe got terrible internet traffic. I might have to go to starbucks for any work based on 
			online resources, like TOEFL preparation and Spring-boot studying. 

			However, the network in zoo cafe is not always unacceptable. During the not-busy time, the bandwidth can reach 
			half of the starbucks, which enables me to do almost any of my works. 

			I have to admit that the network in zoo cafe is not stable enough for me to carry on with serious works. I got 
			to migrate to starbucks if I want to take a TOEFL practice test. 
		}
		
	} and 8 hour{

		1 hour{
			taking courses from kaptest.com, and form a plan for the study of such a course. 
			
			Questions on the TOEFL exam:

				1. In what pattern does the total number of reading and listening tasks vary?

				2. Does the 20 minute of speaking include the time of recepting information?
				Yes. The total times for the 4 sections are close approximations. For example, each speaking task is 
				approximated as 3-4 minutes, including about 2 min reception and about 1 min speech.

==========2017-03-16=========>
As planned, TOEFL practice exam 2 and 3 shall be completed today. However, because of the power off since last night,
the plan has to be changed. 

It is still possible for me to finish exam 2 tonight back home. Before that, I got about 4 hours this afternoon in the 
cafe. This cafe is perfect for work to me for two reasons. The first reason is that it has everything I need like warm
temperature, powersupply, a clean toilet, coffee and dessert. The second reason is that people in the cafe are nice and 
well dressed which makes me feel comfortable and focus on my work better. 

I would appreciate this 4 hours very much. I can work on the next chapter in Pro Spring Boot or/and I can also work on 
Chapter 3 in OCJP8 textbook. However, both works are tough. For Chapter3 in OCJP8, I was stacked with the inner classes.
Also I'm familliar with 4 different kinds of inner classes, it is a complex topic and very hard to keep track on every 
details. I'm always thinking of make a better score in the OCPJ8 exam, which brings me even more stress on reading the 
textbook. 

Anyway, the plan for this afternoon is made in 2 parts. The first part is about reading the OCJP8 textbook. It may take about
2 hours to finish the Third Chapter and to take notes. Before the second part is a refreshment. The second part is about
an exploration over the next chapter in Pro Spring Boot, which will result in a thorough plan of learning this Chapter.  


==========2017-03-15=========>

Today I'm doing TOEFL preparing tests to get a taste on the exam. However, nobody would score writing and speaking 
for me. The good thing is that I can see the scores on reading and listening. If I got poor score on listening, then
I'd better look for some support on listening training. For writing and speaking, I can reread or reheard my submit
myself, and to see if any improvment I can do. 

So far, I got 2 sets of exercises without audio and 2 sets with audio. These 2 with audio are very valuable to me. 
So I'm going to take the audioless exercises first. 

As told in the OG book, one exercise could take 4 hours including a 10min break. I'd better do one exercise per day, 
so that leave enough time to recheck and revise. Consider 6hrs work per day is comfortable to me, I may still get enough
time to keep the warmth on Java 8 and Spring-boot. 

But first, I'm going to check the structure of exercise 1 to see if it is organized as expected in the real exam. This 
process will take like 10 min. 

After then, I will take lunch and coffee.

============Homework========>

There are two more things left for OAuth2 integration in Spring-boot:

	1. access the OAuth2 userId and secrete from server 

	2. Use a JS client to get and use the OAuth2 token. 

Besides, one or more articles shall be read to understand OAuth2 better. 


============2017-03-12======>

Currently I'm working on TOEFL. Preparation for TOEFL can take 100hrs or so. 

Also, I'm learning Spring-boot then native spring cloud application which include two books and a lot coding.
This spring related course can take up to 2 monthes and 4 hrs per day, or 300 hrs.

The last thing I'm currently working at is the Java 8 exam which requires reading a 500-pages book and finish
all the exercises. From my experience, this work yells 3 weeks work and 6 hours per day, or 150 hrs. 

Since I got about 10 hrs per day, these 3 courses all together takes about 2 monthes, which leave me no free 
time before May.

After May, I got 3 or 4 things to worry about. 

The first thing is to earn some money with my english or computing skills. 

The second thing is to take the Network and Computing Security Course from MIT which is already downloaded to 
my desktop.

The third thing is to read about cloud computing. 

The fourth thing is to learn about webpage design. 



However, if I can optimize my reading & learning strategy, time may be saved. Also, if I reallocate the timetable
for different courses, I may achieve at least one goal earlier. 

Among all the 3 short-term goals, TOEFL is the easist to accomplish. To accomplish TOEFL, I need to practice on
all of the 4 aspects of TOEFL English: reading, writing, listening and speaking. 

Reading is the easiest to practice. I've already got enough practice questions and can start and finish it shortly.

Listening is easy to practice too, but I need an ear phone first. However, I need an expensive earphone. 

For writing and speaking, peer review is necessary. I need to upgrade my appearance and invest time and energy to 
explore the local society, foreign society as well as the academy society in SHJD university. 

Besides peer reviewing, machine checking is also helpful. Most likely useful apps could be found in the App Store. 

The expensive earphone can be used as a valuable asset in the next courses, because it enables me to listen to lectures.

The upgraded appearance and social contact are reusable too.
