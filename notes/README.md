This book is 300 pages long, with 17 chapters. It takes more than 30 hours to just read it through. Considering the time to setup sample environment, and the time to sample its functionalities, the total time consumption of reading this book can go as high as 170 hours, which means one chapter per day. 

In fact, even a chapter per day is a difficult goal to achieve. I have to plan three or four days break into the whole journey, as well as three or four days of reviewing and rereading for some difficult parts. Therefore, the total time consumption can be as long as 24 days, finish before the second monday of August, which is August 13. 

During this 3 weeks long journey, I must stay anxious, curious, and proud of what I'm doing. I must keep reminding myself about the value of this technology. I must know that I am a young software architect rising as a sun in the morning. I am capable of developing softwares that solves the problem in the real life. I can always sense the true need of people and I work hard to deliver a product that suites the most important need of my customer. I need cloud foundry, the cloud framework to extend the capability of my works to handle even the most heavy liftings. I need the cloud foundry framework to reduce the complexity of my works by thousands of times. I need my work to be developed fast, maintained easily and good to sale to the people who really need them. I am starting the revolution from this book.
