UML, since 1997, is a language supported by diagrams. The uml diagrams are listed below:

1. use case diagrams

2. class

3. sequence

4. statechart

5. activity

6. component

7. deployment



1. use case diagrams

	A use case diagrams shows system responsibilities(In Oval), system users(custom drawing) and the mapping from users to system responsibilities 

2. class

	A class diagram shows the static OO structure of the system. It consists classes and the relatonships between classes.
	
	Classes are represented in three parts: name, fields, and methods.
	
	The relationship between classes are 
	
		1. IS-A relationship (repreneted by a close-head arrow)
		
		2. Referencial Has-A relationship (repreneted by a open-head arrow with a quantifier "1" or "*")
		
		3. Mutual Has-A relationship (represented by a line with quantifiers like "1..*" in both ends)
		
		
3. sequence

	A sequence diagram shows the work flow in two dimensions:
	
		the vertical dimension shows time, start from top
		
		the horizontal dimension shows classes, start from the left
		
		The work flow is now a sequence of calls from class to class. Each call is represented by an concrete arrow from the sender to the 
		receiver, and the return value is optionally represented by a dotted arrow of backward direction.

4. statechart

	Statechart is to represent the states of some classes of more than three states. 

5. activity

	An activity diagram is like a sequence diagram, but mostly used in high level modeling. 

6. component

	A component diagram represents a system with all the components.

7. deployment

	A deployment diagram involed both components and their deployment environments
