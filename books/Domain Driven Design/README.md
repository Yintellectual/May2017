Modeling
	: an abstraction of the subject
Domain
	: set of the the subjects that is considered

Domain Model
	: an abstraction of the considered system of subjects.
	
5 Things to form domain model

	1. Binding the model to the implementation
	
	2. Cultivate a language with the model
	
	3. Developing a knowledge-rich model
	
	4. Distilling the model
	
	5. Brainstorm and experimenting
	
Policy, Strategy and Business Logic

The UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE is backed by the domain model, and used by both the developer and the domain experts. It's very usage
is a good way to refine the domain model design.

It is necessary to have a diagram of domain models when discussing about the software system, especially with non-programmers. 
In such a diagram, both entities and methods should be well abstracted into fictional terms.  The purpose is to provide concise 
and precise vocabulary to communicate. However, this vocabulary should be used in domain modeling as well as coding.
