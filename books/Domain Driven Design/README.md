Modeling
	: an abstraction of the subject
Domain
	: set of the the subjects that is considered

Domain Model
	: an abstraction of the considered system of subjects.
	
5 Things to form domain model

	1. Binding the model to the implementation
	
	2. Cultivate a language with the model
	
	3. Developing a knowledge-rich model
	
	4. Distilling the model
	
	5. Brainstorm and experimenting
	
Policy, Strategy and Business Logic

The UBIQUITOUS LANGUAGE is backed by the domain model, and used by both the developer and the domain experts. It's very usage
is a good way to refine the domain model design.

It is necessary to have a diagram of domain models when discussing about the software system, especially with non-programmers. 
In such a diagram, both entities and methods should be well abstracted into fictional terms.  The purpose is to provide concise 
and precise vocabulary for communication. However, this vocabulary should be used in domain modeling as well as coding. 

Explanatory model is unlike domain model. An explanatory model is applied on an abstract concept of the domain model, to help 
people understand its concept. There is no need for uml in explanatory model. Diagrams and human language can be good choices. 

Analysis model is a super set of domain model. It represents an analysis of the business domain. However, there can be many analysis
models for the same business domain and not every one of them are suitable to be implemented into codes. Choosing and refining the 
analysis model to gain a model that can be applied on both business domian and codes.
